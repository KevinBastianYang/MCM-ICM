Well studied for its direct impact, Climate Change is recently found to
have the potential to weaken government and sociality and increase of instability
in a vulnerable state. In this paper, a synthesized method is developed
to evaluate the impact of climate change on regional fragility.


In task 1, we collect and analyze many indicators that influence a state’s
fragility, and classify them into 4 categories. After that, we select 16 indicators
as our final assessment indicators. In our model, we use Fragility
Score to evaluate a state’s fragility considering both direct and indirect impact
from climate change. In stage 1, we combine both Analytic Hierarchy
Process and Entropy Method to calculate the impact in a more balanced way.
We adjust the proportion of Analytic Hierarchy Process and Entropy method
to improve the performance. In stage 2, we modify our model to get better
evaluation results.


In task 2, we select Sudan as our simulation target. The rising temperature
and exacerbating desertification will increase Sudan’s fragility. Furthermore,
we use our model to show that Sudan will be less fragile without those
climate change effects.


In task 3, we select Bangladesh to illustrate how climate change may
push a country to be more fragile. According to the trend of 24 different
countries’ fragility score, we define the tipping point to assess when a
country will become more fragile. We predict every indicator’s value of
Bangladesh in the future 10 years by Artificial Neural Network. We get the
fragile score of Bangladesh in the future 10 years and explain the fragility
variation of Bangladesh.


In task 4, we categorize some state driven interventions. We select some
specific interventions in Sudan and Bangladesh and illustrate effect and cost
of these interventions.


In task 5, we find the fragility scores of Russia and Singapore keep a consistency
with the results proposed by the Fragile State Index, which demonstrates
a relatively great applicability.
